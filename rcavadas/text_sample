Michel Fourniret (born 4 April 1942) is a convicted French serial killer who confessed in June and July 2004 to kidnapping, raping and murdering nine girls
in a span of 14 years from the 1980s to the 2000s. He was also accused of 10
additional murders, nine in France and one in Belgium, and was found guilty of
seven of these charges. The trials started on 27 March 2008, and ended on 28
May. He is 
sometimes 
referred to 
as the "Ogre/Beast of the Ardennes".

Fourniret was arrested after a failed attempt to kidnap a Belgian girl in June
2003. His wife, Monique Olivier, exposed him after hearing the news of another
child murderer's wife (Michelle Martin, wife of Marc Dutroux) being convicted.
Fourniret was charged with the abduction of minors and sexual misconduct, and
has been in detention since June 2003 for the attempted kidnapping of a
14-year-old girl in 2000. Olivier was charged with one murder and for helping
him with a further six.

Fourniret buried at least two of his victims at his Sautou chateau near Donchery
in the French Ardennes in the late 1980s. On 3 July 2004, a team of French and
Belgian police recovered the bodies of two of Fourniret's victims near the
chateau. Fourniret was sentenced to life in prison; Olivier was sentenced to
life with no possibility of parole for 28 years.
